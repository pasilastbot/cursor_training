#Agent rules
1. When I say implement, please implement the code using following steps using chain of thoughts reasoning.
  1.1 REQUIRED: First read these files in order:
    1. @architecture.md
    2. @datamodel.md
    3. @backend.md or @frontend.md (based on query)
  1.2 Chain of thoughts must follow this format:
    1. "Reading required files..."
    2. "Analysis: what I found in the files..."
    3. "Plan: what needs to be done..."
    4. "Implementation: how I'll do it..."
  1.3 Seek the codebase for relevant files and methods first for getting context. Don't make assumptions.
  1.4 Place frontend code in the frontend directory and backend code in the backend directory
  1.5 Before proceeding with implementation:
    - Confirm all required files were read
    - List key findings from each file
    - Explain how these findings inform the implementation
6. When I say validate, please review and validate the code for correctness and execute the unit tests for it. If you don't have unit tests, please create them.
7. When I say record, write summary of what you did in the @ai_changelog.md and update the todo list in the @todo.md (do not remove any tasks, just update their status)
