# Cursor AI Training Course

This repository contains a comprehensive training course for developing AI-powered applications using Cursor IDE. The course provides hands-on experience with both frontend and backend development, following best practices and structured learning paths.

## 📚 Course Structure

The course is organized into several key components:

- **Documentation** (`/docs`): Contains detailed technical documentation and architecture guidelines
- **Implementation Prompts** (`/prompts`): Step-by-step guides and prompts for implementing features
- **Backend** (`/backend`): Server-side implementation and API endpoints
- **Frontend** (`/frontend`): Client-side application and user interface
- **Source** (`/src`): Core source code and shared utilities

## 🗂️ Key Resources

### Documentation
- Architecture Documentation: `/docs/architecture.md`
- Data Model Documentation: `/docs/datamodel.md`
- Backend Documentation: `/docs/backend.md`
- Frontend Documentation: `/docs/frontend.md`

### Implementation Guides
- Implementation Prompts: `/prompts/implementation_prompts.md`
- Task Management: `@todo.md`
- Change Log: `@ai_changelog.md`

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Review the architecture documentation in the `/docs` folder
2. Follow the implementation prompts in `/prompts/implementation_prompts.md`
3. Track progress using the todo list and changelog
4. Implement features following the backend-first, frontend-second approach

## 📝 Development Workflow

1. Read required documentation:
   - `@architecture.md`
   - `@datamodel.md`
   - `@backend.md` or `@frontend.md` (based on task)
2. Follow implementation prompts
3. Validate code through testing
4. Record changes in changelog
5. Update todo list

## 🤖 AI-Driven Development

This course emphasizes AI-driven development practices using Cursor IDE, focusing on:
- Structured implementation approaches
- Test-driven development
- Documentation-first methodology
- Iterative feature development

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Track your progress through:
- Task completion in `@todo.md`
- Implementation history in `@ai_changelog.md`
- Commit history in the repository
